# The Centrum AgentKit
## A [Centrum](https://github.com/AbstractedCo/centrum) Network [subxt](https://docs.rs/subxt/latest/subxt/) based SDK for Omnichain AI Agentics.
The Centrum AgentKit is a powerful, decentralized solution that enables AI agents to seamlessly interact with any blockchain, protocol, or plugin within the Web3 ecosystem. It provides a unified interface that abstracts the complexities of cross-chain communication, allowing developers to build intelligent, autonomous agents that can execute transactions, analyze on-chain data, and interact with decentralized applications (dApps) effortlessly.

With Centrum AgentKit, AI agents gain universal blockchain access, unlocking new possibilities for automation, DeFi, governance, and beyondâ€”without the need for fragmented integrations.

## Development of the Centrum AgentKit v1.0 is currently underway.

### To use the SDK as a ts/js library compile it using wasm-pack.
